Welcome to my personal website! I am fifth year PhD student in Applied Mathematics at the [University of Colorado at Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/) working with [Stephen Becker](https://amath.colorado.edu/faculty/becker/). I focus primarily on numerical optimization, inverse problems, and regression subject to uncertain data. Although this website is under construction, you can find information about my research interests and a few of the projects I've worked on over the years. More will be added over time. 

__I plan to graduate in May-August 2022 and will be on the job market!__

## Recent News
### September 2021
- Our paper ["A study of scalar optically-pumped magnetometers for use in magnetoencephalography without shielding"](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6560/ac18fb) was accepted by _Physics in Medicine and Biology_. A preprint can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.02316).

### July 2021
- I presented our recent work on uncertain regression problems at SIAM OPT, Spokane, WA (remote). Slides can be found [here](/assets/documents/siam_opt21.pdf).

### May 2021
- For the summer, I will be splitting time between [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/) as a Givens Associate and [Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://www.lanl.gov). A central focus of my work will be on efficient computation using mixed precision floating point arithmetic and its limitations in scientific computing.

### April 2021
- I successfully passed my comprehensive exams! Thank you to my committee, Stephen Becker, Svenja Knappe, Jem Corcoran, Emiliano Dall'Anese , and Will Kleiber.  
- We posted our preprint ["Approximate maximum likelihood estimators for linear regression with design matrix uncertainty"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03307) to ArXiv.

### March 2021 
- Our work on approximate maximum likelihood estimation for regression was presented at SIAM FRAMC in Denver, CO (remote). Slides can be found [here](/assets/documents/Approximate_MLE_presentation.pdf).

### November 2020
- Our paper ["Robust least squares for quantized data matrices](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165168420302541) was accepted at _Signal Processing_. 

### June 2020
- [Rocky Clancy](http://www.rockwellfclancy.com/research.html) (my brother and an ethicist) will be presenting work on ["Mapping concepts engineering students in China use to think about ethics"](https://peer.asee.org/mapping-concepts-engineering-students-in-china-use-to-think-about-ethics). Although I only contributed a bit of code, I am happy to have two Clancys on a conference proceeding. 

### May 2020
- My summer will be spent at [FieldLine, Inc.](https://fieldlineinc.com/) continuing work on the simulation and the solution of inverse problems for brain imaging. 

### March 2020
- A preprint for our new paper ["Robust least squares for quantized data matrices"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12004) can be found on arXiv.

### May 2019
- I will be interning at [Sensory, Inc.](https://www.sensory.com/) as part of the Vision Research team.

### January 2019
- I have officially completed the preliminary exam portion of the PhD degree by passing the Probability and Statistics exam! In addition, I am done with my course work!

### August 2018
- To my great relief, I passed the Numerical Analysis and Applied Analysis preliminary exams!
