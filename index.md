Welcome to my personal website! I am fifth year PhD student in Applied Mathematics at the [University of Colorado - Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/) working with [Stephen Becker](https://amath.colorado.edu/faculty/becker/). I focus on numerical optimization, inverse problems, and regression subject to uncertain data. I have a broad background in algorithms used for machine learning, signal processing, and physical simulations. Although this website is a work in progress, you can find information about my research including a few projects I've worked on over the years. I am defending my dissertation April 5th, 2022.

___I am on the job market to start this summer!___

# Recent News

### February 2022

- Hot off the press! Read about [TROPHY](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08387), a trust region algorithm that uses mixed precision arithmetic for function and gradient evaluations to reduce the computational load for numerical optimization.

### December 2021

- I was fortunate to share my work on brain imaging and other topics in applied math with the [Institute for Human Neuroscience](https://www.boystownhospital.org/research/institute-human-neuroscience) at Boys Town Research Hospital in Omaha, Nebraska.

### September 2021

- Our paper [&#34;A study of scalar optically-pumped magnetometers for use in magnetoencephalography without shielding&#34;](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6560/ac18fb) was accepted by _Physics in Medicine and Biology_. A preprint can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.02316).

### July 2021

- Presented our recent work on uncertain regression problems at SIAM OPT, Spokane, WA (remote). Slides can be found [here](/assets/documents/siam_opt21.pdf).

### May 2021

- For the summer, I will be splitting time between [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/) as a Givens Associate and [Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://www.lanl.gov). A central focus of my work will be on efficient computation using mixed precision floating point arithmetic and its limitations in scientific computing.

### April 2021

- I successfully passed my comprehensive exams! Thank you to my committee, Stephen Becker, Svenja Knappe, Jem Corcoran, Emiliano Dall'Anese , and Will Kleiber.
- We posted our preprint [&#34;Approximate maximum likelihood estimators for linear regression with design matrix uncertainty&#34;](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03307) to ArXiv.

### March 2021

- Our work on approximate maximum likelihood estimation for regression was presented at SIAM FRAMC in Denver, CO (remote). Slides can be found [here](/assets/documents/Approximate_MLE_presentation.pdf).

### November 2020

- Our paper [&#34;Robust least squares for quantized data matrices](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165168420302541) was accepted at _Signal Processing_.

### June 2020

- [Rocky Clancy](http://www.rockwellfclancy.com/research.html) (my brother and an ethicist) will be presenting work on [&#34;Mapping concepts engineering students in China use to think about ethics&#34;](https://peer.asee.org/mapping-concepts-engineering-students-in-china-use-to-think-about-ethics). Although I only contributed a bit of code, I am happy to have two Clancys on a conference proceeding.

### May 2020

- My summer will be spent at [FieldLine, Inc.](https://fieldlineinc.com/) continuing work on the simulation and solution of inverse problems for brain imaging.

### March 2020

- A preprint for our new paper [&#34;Robust least squares for quantized data matrices&#34;](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12004) can be found on arXiv.

### May 2019

- I will be interning at [Sensory, Inc.](https://www.sensory.com/) as part of the Vision Research team.

### January 2019

- I have officially completed the preliminary exam portion of the PhD degree by passing the Probability and Statistics exam! In addition, I am done with course work!

### August 2018

- To my great relief, I passed the Numerical Analysis and Applied Analysis preliminary exams!
