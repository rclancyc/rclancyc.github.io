Before moving to beautiful Boulder, my wife and I lived in Austin, TX. I completed my MS degree in Applied Mathematics at [Texas State University](https://www.txstate.edu/) (formerly Southwest Texas State), the alma mater of Lyndon B. Johnson. I worked closely with Professor [Young Ju Lee](https://www.math.txstate.edu/about/people/faculty/lee.html).

Prior to graduate school, I spent 8 years in the financial industry as an analyst and futures/options trader in Austin and Houston. I received my Bachelor's degree in Physics from CU Boulder.

I hold a private pilot's certificate and enjoy flying all over Colorado. Although apartment living makes woodworking difficult, I enjoy furniture building and have made several pieces that are (surprisingly) still standing. As with many other Coloradans, I like to ski and punish myself by taking unpleasantly long hikes.
