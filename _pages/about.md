Before moving to beautiful Boulder, my wife and I lived in Austin, TX home to an unusually large urban bat colony living under the Congress St bring. I completed my MS degree in Applied Mathematics at [Texas State University](https://www.txstate.edu/) (formerly Southwest Texas State), Lyndon B. Johnson's alma mater.

Prior to graduate school, I spent 8 years in the financial industry as an analyst and futures/options trader in Austin and Houston. I received my Bachelor's degree in Physics from CU Boulder.

I have my private pilot's certificate and enjoy get flying all over Colorado. Although apartment living makes woodworking difficult, I enjoy furniture building and have mades several pieces that are (surprisingly) still standing. As with many other Coloradans, I like to ski and punish myself by taking unpleasantly long hikes.
